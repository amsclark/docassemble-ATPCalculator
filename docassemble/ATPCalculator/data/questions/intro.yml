question: Iowa Ability to Pay Calculator
progress: 5
subquestion: |
  In Iowa, some people have to pay "court debt." Court debt is money they owe because of their involvement in a criminal, civil, or juvenile case. This debt can include fines and payments to victims. It can also include fees for court services, jail, or defense lawyers. Fees for court services, jail, or defense lawyers should only be charged if the person has the ability to pay them. 
  
  The law requires an assessment of a person's ability to pay. But the law doesn't give clear guidance on what that means. This calculator tries to make the issue more concrete by borrowing a model called the [Collection Financial Standards](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/collection-financial-standards) which has been used by the Internal Revenue Service for a long time. These standards are based on updated information from various government agencies. The information includes costs of housing, food, medicine, transportation, and other important expenses. This information helps determine the realistic costs of basic household needs without requiring a person who owes court debt, their lawyer, or the court to go through a lot of paperwork.

  # How to use this calculator
  
  This calculator has **two parts** â€“ one required, and one optional. 
  
  * The first part is an ability to pay calculator. This part uses the [collection financial standards](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/collection-financial-standards) used by the Internal Revenue Service to determine if they should take action to collect taxes owed to the federal government. <strong><span style="color: green"> It should take about 3 to 5 minutes to complete.</span></strong>
  
  * The second part, which is optional, helps create a **financial affidavit** that can be edited. This affidavit is required when asking to reduce court debt resulting from a criminal conviction. You can file this affidavit directly with court. Alternatively, if you are a lawyer, you can ask your client to fill out the affidavit and the program will email the document to you for review. <strong><span style="color: green"> This part should take an additional 5 to 10 minutes to complete.</span></strong>
