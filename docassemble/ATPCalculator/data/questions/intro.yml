question: Iowa Ability to Pay Calculator
progress: 5
subquestion: |
  Under Iowa law, some people are assessed "court debt" – i.e. debt people owe due to their involvement in a criminal, civil, or juvenile case. This can include fines and victim restitution, but also a range of fees for the services of a court, a jail, or appointed defense counsel. Much of these fees in the latter category of debt are only supposed to be charged if the person has the "ability to pay."
  
  Even though the law requires an ability to pay assessment, it doesn't provide much guidance on what that means. This calculator attempts to make the issue more concrete by borrowing a long-standing model from the Internal Revenue Service – the [collection financial standards](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/collection-financial-standards). This standards are based on periodically updated data from a number of federal agencies about costs of housing, food, medicine, transportation, and other important costs. This data gives a picture of the realistic costs of maintaining basic household necessities without requiring a defendant, their lawyer, or the court to go through a mountain of documentation.
  
  This calculator is a demo, and the final version will be tentatively be released and hosted elsewhere later in 2022. Please email Alex Kornya at [akornya@iowalaw.org](mailto:akornya@iowalaw.org) or text to (515) 400-3618 if you have any feedback about how the final version of the calculator could be better.

  # How to use this calculator
  
  This calculator has **two parts** – one required, and one optional. 
  
  * The first part is an ability to pay calculator, which uses the [collection financial standards](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/collection-financial-standards) established by the Internal Revenue Service to decide whether to take collection action against people who owe federal taxes. <strong><span style="color: green">This part of the process should take between 3 and 5 minutes to complete.</span></strong>
  
  * The second, optional part of the interview will create an **editable financial affidavit** that is required when asking to reduce some court debt assessed as part of a criminal conviction. This affidavit can be filed directly with court. Alternatively, a lawyer can ask their client to fill out the affidavit and then have the program email the document to the lawyer for review. <strong><span style="color: green">This should take an additional 5 to 10 minutes to complete.</span></strong>
