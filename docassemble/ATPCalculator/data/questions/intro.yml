question: Ability to Pay Calculator
progress: 5
subquestion: |
  Under state and federal law, people can be ordered to pay "court debt." Court debt is debt people owe because of their involvement in a criminal, civil, or juvenile case. This can include fines and victim restitution, but also many different kinds of fees for the services of a court, a jail, an interpreter, appointed defense counsel for people who cannot otherwise pay, etc. Depending on the state, some or all types of court debt can only be charged to someone if they have the "ability to pay" them. 
  
  Even though the law requires a court to figure out someone's ability to pay before imposing / modifying / enforcing court debt, it doesn't provide much guidance on what "ability to pay" actually means. This calculator provides a concrete, evidenced based determination by borrowing a long-standing model from the Internal Revenue Service – the [collection financial standards](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/collection-financial-standards). This standards are based on periodically updated data from a number of federal agencies. This data standardizes costs of housing, food, medicine, transportation, and other basic necessities. This data gives a picture of the realistic costs of the minimum costs of maintaining miminum household expenses without requiring a person, their lawyer, or the court to go through a mountain of documentation of actual expenses. The calculator also ensures that ability to pay amounts are not artificially frozen at a level that is less than what is required to maintain the basics.
  
  This calculator is a demo, and the final version will be tentatively be released and hosted elsewhere later in 2025. Please email Alex Kornya at [alexkornya@justice4all.org](mailto:alexkornya@justice4all.org) if you have any feedback about how the final version of the calculator could be better.

  # How to use this calculator
  
  This calculator has **two parts** – one required, and one optional. 
  
  * The first part is an ability to pay calculator. This part uses the [collection financial standards](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/collection-financial-standards) used by the Internal Revenue Service to determine if they should take action to collect taxes owed to the federal government. <strong><span style="color: green"> It should take about 3 to 5 minutes to complete.</span></strong>
  
  * The second part, which is optional, helps create a **financial affidavit** that can be edited. This affidavit is required when asking to reduce court debt resulting from a criminal conviction. You can file this affidavit directly with court. Alternatively, if you are a lawyer, you can ask your client to fill out the affidavit and the program will email the document to you for review. <strong><span style="color: green"> This part should take an additional 5 to 10 minutes to complete.</span></strong>
