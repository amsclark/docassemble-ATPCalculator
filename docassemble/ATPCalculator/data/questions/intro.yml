question: Ability to Pay Calculator
progress: 5
subquestion: |
  Under state and federal law, people can be ordered to pay "court debt." Court debt is debt people owe because of their involvement in a criminal, civil, or juvenile case. This can include fines and victim restitution, but also many different kinds of fees for the services of a court, a jail, an interpreter, appointed defense counsel for people who cannot otherwise pay, etc. Depending on the state, some or all types of court debt can only be charged to someone if they have the "ability to pay" them. 
  
  Even though the law requires a court to figure out someone's ability to pay before imposing / modifying / enforcing court debt, it doesn't provide much guidance on what "ability to pay" actually means. This calculator provides a concrete, evidenced based determination by borrowing a long-standing model from the Internal Revenue Service – the [collection financial standards](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/collection-financial-standards). This standards are based on periodically updated data from a number of federal agencies. This data standardizes costs of housing, food, medicine, transportation, and other basic necessities. This data gives a picture of the realistic costs of the minimum costs of maintaining miminum household expenses without requiring a person, their lawyer, or the court to go through a mountain of documentation of actual expenses. The calculator also ensures that ability to pay amounts are not artificially frozen at a level that is less than what is required to maintain the basics.
  
  This calculator is a demo, and the final version will be tentatively be released and hosted elsewhere later in 2025. Please email Alex Kornya at [alexkornya@justice4all.org](mailto:alexkornya@justice4all.org) or text to (515) 400-3618 if you have any feedback about how the final version of the calculator could be better.

  # How to use this calculator
  
  This calculator has **two parts** – one required, and one optional. 
  
  * The first part is an ability to pay calculator, which uses the [collection financial standards](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/collection-financial-standards) established by the Internal Revenue Service to decide whether to take collection action against people who owe federal taxes. <strong><span style="color: green">This part of the process should take between 3 and 5 minutes to complete.</span></strong>
  
  * The second, optional part of the interview will create an **editable financial affidavit** that is required when asking to reduce some court debt assessed as part of a criminal conviction. This affidavit can be filed directly with court. Alternatively, a lawyer can ask their client to fill out the affidavit and then have the program email the document to the lawyer for review. <strong><span style="color: green">This should take an additional 5 to 10 minutes to complete.</span></strong>
